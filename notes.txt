Sever command

> npm i express nodemon socket.io cors

 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",

  },

  cors is use to allow  front request to access backend it's use to interacte frontend and backend with  allowing it on certain limit.
  socketio allow real time conversation 


  To connect socketio to react we need to install a library in react to connect react to socketio
  it is not only use in react it is use if you waant to connect to any kind of frontend to connect with socketio
  in react command 
  > npm install socket.io-client
  socket.io-client is the name of the library . This library will allow us to call an instance of it in high level of component (i.e appjs) of react app 
  The import in the app.js (import io from 'socket.io-client';)
  io is going to establish the connection similarly in node.js ,establish connection outside of the component
